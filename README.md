# docker-challenge-template

About challenge1 and 2, I learned how to use docker, how to link VS code to docker, and run in docker.
## Challenge1
download Docker
Add a "public" folder . 
- Add a file with name index.html. It should contain my name and student ID :000885037.
- Create a Dockerfile to use NGinx to serve pages existent on the public folder.
- Create a Docker image.
- Execute docker with the right parameters.
- Commit the Dockerfile and public folder and push it to remote repository.
## Challenge2
Add all files present on challenge2.zip to challenge’s root folder.
- Create a Dockerfile to build the server’s Docker container
- Create the Docker compose file using NGinx and the API server from previous step.
o NGinx should listen on post 8080
- Verify if all services are running properly.
- Open a browser and point it to the address “http://localhost:8080/api/books” ,there is screenshot
- Commit all files and push them to remote repository.
